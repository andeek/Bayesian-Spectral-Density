\paragraph{Spearman's Rank Correlation}
Spearman's rank correlation $\rho$, is a measure of correlation between a bivariate random sample of size $n$. The calculation of this statistic corresponds to Pearson's $r$ computed on the ranks (and average ranks in the case of ties) of the data. It is used as a test statistic to test the null hypothesis $H_0: \text{ The bivariate random sample } X_i \text{ and } Y_i \text{are mutually independent}$ against the alternative hypothesis $H_1:$ Either there is a tendency for the larger values of $X$ to be paired with the larger values of $Y$ or there is a tendency for the smaller values of $X$ to be paired with the larger values of $Y$. An asymptotic $t$ distribution is used to calculate p-values \cite{conover1998practical}.

We used a two-sided Spearman's rank correlation test at the $\alpha = \Sexpr{alpha}$-level to test whether periodogram values at neighboring frequencies (with different inbetween spacings) $\omega_j$ and $\omega_k$ were pairwise independent.


\paragraph{Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test of Distribution}
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is a procedure that uses the maximum vertical distance between an empirical cumulative distribution function and a named cumulative distribution function as a measure of how much the two functions resemble each other. The only assumption of this test is that the data are a random sample. The KS test uses test statistic $T = \sup\limits_x |F^*(x) - S(x)|$ to test the null hypothesis $H_0: F(x) = F^*(x)$ for all $x$, where $F^*(x)$ is the completely specified hypothesized distribution function, $F(x)$ is the unknown distribution function of the data, and $S(x)$ is the empirical distribution function of the data. For data of length $n \le 100$, an exact p-values are available and for data of length $n > 100$, an asymptotic approximation is used \cite{conover1998practical}. The asymptotic distribution is called the Kolmogorov distribution, and is of the form $P(T \le \lambda) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty (-1)^k e^{-2k^2 \lambda^2}$ \cite{kolmogorov1992empirical}.

We used a two-sided KS test at the $\alpha = \Sexpr{alpha}$-level to test whether the distributions of our periodogram values at each frequency $\omega_j$ were exponentially distributed with mean parameter $2\pi f(\omega_j)$, where $f(\omega_j)$ is the spectral density evaluated at $\omega_j$.
